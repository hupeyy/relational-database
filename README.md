To be modified into an "official" assignment the assignment needs to be made slightly harder. I believe adding more functionality like handling mutliple transactions at once would be a good addition. Apart from that I believe being able to run against test cases like in Edugator would be a nice addition. Having 3-4 visual test cases and then 10-15 hidden test cases would be good for faster and clearer grading. Also encouraging to submit their own test cases would be a good idea for some points extra credit.
